## Customization

**Before executing, check for user customizations at:**
`~/.claude/DOS/USER/SKILLCUSTOMIZATIONS/RedTeam/`

If this directory exists, load and apply any PREFERENCES.md, configurations, or resources found there. These override default behavior. If the directory does not exist, proceed with skill defaults.

# RedTeam Skill

Military-grade adversarial analysis using parallel agent deployment. Breaks arguments into atomic components, attacks from 32 expert perspectives (engineers, architects, pentesters, interns), synthesizes findings, and produces devastating counter-arguments with steelman representations.

**Self-differentiation:** Unlike Council (collaborative-adversarial debate) and FirstPrinciples (decompose-and-rebuild), RedTeam is PURELY adversarial. It OWNS *attack / break / devil's-advocate* and *stress-test an argument/plan/claim for fatal flaws (now)*; it composes `FirstPrinciples/Challenge` for assumption-attacks. The temporal axis — *stress-test against the future / across horizons* — defers to WorldThreatModelHarness; empirical/measure intent defers to Science.

## Workflow Routing

Route to the appropriate workflow based on the request.

**When executing a workflow, output this notification directly:**

```
Running the **WorkflowName** workflow in the **RedTeam** skill to ACTION...
```

| Trigger | Workflow |
|---------|----------|
| Red team analysis (stress-test existing content) | `Workflows/ParallelAnalysis.md` |
| Adversarial validation (produce new content via competition) | `Workflows/AdversarialValidation.md` |

---

## Quick Reference

| Workflow | Purpose | Output |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **ParallelAnalysis** | Stress-test existing content | Steelman + Counter-argument (8-points each) |
| **AdversarialValidation** | Produce new content via competition | Synthesized solution from competing proposals |

**The Five-Phase Protocol (ParallelAnalysis):**
1. **Decomposition** - Break into 24 atomic claims
2. **Parallel Analysis** - 32 agents examine strengths AND weaknesses
3. **Synthesis** - Identify convergent insights
4. **Steelman** - Strongest version of the argument
5. **Counter-Argument** - Strongest rebuttal

## Examples

**Attack an architecture proposal:**
```
User: "red team this microservices migration plan"
--> Workflows/ParallelAnalysis.md
--> Returns steelman + devastating counter-argument (8 points each)
```

**Devil's advocate on a business decision:**
```
User: "poke holes in my plan to raise prices 20%"
--> Workflows/ParallelAnalysis.md
--> Surfaces the ONE core issue that could collapse the plan
```

**Adversarial validation for content:**
```
User: "battle of bots - which approach is better for this feature?"
--> Workflows/AdversarialValidation.md
--> Synthesizes best solution from competing ideas
```
